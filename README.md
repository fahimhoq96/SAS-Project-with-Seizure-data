# SAS-Project-with-Seizure-data

# About Data Sets
This data comes from a clinical trial on 59 individuals with epilepsy. Patients suffering from simple or partial seizures were randomized to groups receiving either the anti-epileptic drug progabide, or a placebo, as an adjuvant to standard chemotherapy. The number of seizures was counted over four two-week periods. There was also a baseline seizure rate recorded for each patient based on the 8-week pre-randomization seizure count.

# Tasks done:

1. Using PROC FREQ determine how many patients were randomized to the placebo and how many were randomized to the progabide treatment.
2. Using PROC MEANS to find the total number, MEAN and Standard deviation of seizure rate at baseline by treatment.
3. Using PROC MEANS find the mean, standard deviation and median seizure rates within each treatment group at each week following treatment.
4. Using PROC PLOT to plot of the seizure rate at week 4 (Seizure4) vs the baseline seizure rate (BaseSeizure) for each treatment group.
